# :page_facing_up: Resume :page_with_curl:

Small setup for managing resume as a single data file. To make it happen, it were setted up with `webpack` (to prepare assets / interpolate data from data.json file) and template designed by [Xiaoying Riley](https://themes.3rdwavemedia.com/) (to make it pretty).

## Left todo:

- [ ] Add `percy` snapshot test.

- [ ] Add basic integration test.

- [ ] Add resume picture.

- [ ] Setup actions for running tests.

- [ ] Setup continues delivery to Github Pages.
